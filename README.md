# This is Samuel Charest Exercise Repo

We use **this file** to practice markdown

We have tried:

1. `git clone`: this is how you copy/download a repo
2. `git status`: this shows the status of the current repo
3. `git add .`: this stages all changes
4. `git commit -am "commit msg"`: this commits the changes to the repo
